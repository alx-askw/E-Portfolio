                <h5>Bio</h5>
                <p>I am a Junior Software Engineer specializing in the MERN stack, adept at building full-stack web applications. I recently graduated from Digital Futures, preceded by earning a degree in computer science from the University of Greenwich. Throughout my academic journey and professional experiences, I have consistently demonstrated dedication, effective problem-solving skills, a passionate approach to my work, and a strong hunger for learning and overcoming challenges. </p>

                <ul>
                    <h6>Digital Futures | June  2023 –  December 2023</h6>
                    <p>
                        My software engineering training consisted of:
                        <ul>
                            • MERN Stack. Spearheaded the development of multiple full stack projects, demonstrating proficiency in MongoDB, ExpressJS, React, and NodeJS, as well as test-driven development. A key project I worked on was a platform for users to create portfolio-esqe profiles, where I worked as part of a team, applying agile methodolgies as well as making constant use of git strategies to streamline the development process..
                        </ul>
                        <ul>
                            • Java. I obtained Oracle’s 1Z0-811 Java Foundations Certification, with a score of 93% as part of my training which demonstrates my understanding of Java, as well as my ability to learn concepts and technologies quickly and in considerable depth.
                        </ul>
                        <ul>
                            • Agile. I worked in teams on different projects where we worked in an agile enviroment. Abiding by agile values meant that I attended daily standups and code reviews. A key measure we employed to be productive was to have sprint plans and retrospectives which allowed me and my team to communicate, leading us to work like a well oiled machine. Additionaly, we commuicated reguarly with the product owner to make sure the product was being developed correctly.
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <h6>•Tesco | November  2022 – January 2023</h6>
                    <p>For the Christmas period I worked nights preparing the products on the shop floor for when the customers arrive. The job required learning the correct positions for many products so the shelves could be filled efficiently, whilst maintaining a clean and tidy store for the customers. My shift overlapped with the opening and closing times of the store, which meant I came into contact with the customers, during these times I would make sure that the customers were accommodated.</p>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <h6>•Jacobi Jayne & Co | July 2021 – Sept 2021</h6>
                    <p>Whilst working for Jacobi Jayne & Co, most of my time was spent on an assembly line where speed, efficiency, and cooperation were required. Each line would consist of about four people which meant that being efficient was required as to not be the weakest link in the chain but keeping each product up to Jacobi Jayne’s gold standard was also required. Co-operation with my colleagues allowed for the upkeep of the quality standard as well as the efficiency of the line..</p>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <h6>•3D Displays Ltd | Feb 2020 – Aug 2020 </h6>
                    <p>In terms of what I did to make sure I was:
                        <ul>• Safe. I would always follow the protocols that were explained to me, as a lot of the machines, chemicals and appliances could be dangerous if handled incorrectly.</ul>
                        <ul>• Providing quality by taking minor amounts of time to evaluate what I had done and to make adjustments if needed. I also looked out for products that had imperfections or products that weren’t up to 3D Displays’ standard.</ul>
                        <ul>• Being efficient, I would move at a fast pace to keep the product line moving forward. As aforementioned I would take small amounts of time to make sure that a product was up to the standard that it needed to be. I am quite good at getting into the rhythm of a process and finding ways to make a process easier to complete in succession, whilst being concentrated. </ul></p>

                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <p>•Driven by my love for learning, I have recently embarked on teaching myself Russian. Specfifically the unique challenge that it doesn’t use the Latin alphabet, and my keen interest in the language itself motivates me to dedicate time and effort over an extended period. </p>
                </ul>
                <h6>Mathematics</h6>
                <ul>
                    <p>Whilst at university, I studied the mathematics that are used within the software and hardware of computer systems. This exposure not only fostered a newfound appreciation for mathematics but also revealed its crucial role in areas such as AI and machine learning, which became focal points of my studies as my final year project for university was using an unsupervised machine learning model to carry out natural language processing.</p>
